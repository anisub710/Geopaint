# Geo-Paint
This repository contains code for a location-based drawing app, created for the [Android Development](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1160645) course at the UW iSchool.
Thanks to [QuadFlask](https://github.com/QuadFlask) for the [colorpicker library](https://github.com/QuadFlask/colorpicker), which was used in this application to chose the color of the path (in the settings fragment).
